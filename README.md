# Drawing and chat server 

This is the repo for the server of the DrawChat app as shown on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJq0-4GvbNc

Please note the code is unrefined. The drawing are made using line objects and are not saved as pixels on a canvas in this version. 

This was mainly for myself to learn about networking in C# so it is by no means refined.
